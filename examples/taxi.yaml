  - It was raining steadily by the time I dropped my last rider off[...] and swung by the post office on my way home.
  - choice:
    - The post office was closed[.], but I let myself in to the PO box room.
    - The fluorescent glare hurt my eyes after the evening of headlight
      glare.
      - choice:
          - I quietly cursed the light, wishing for the dark.
      - choice: I quietly gave thanks for the light.
  - I found my box, lucky 1313.
  - text: What a lovely number.
