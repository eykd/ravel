  - It was raining steadily by the time I dropped my last rider off[...] and swung by the post office on my way home.
  - choice:
    - The post office was closed[.], but I let myself in to the PO box room.
    - The fluorescent glare hurt my eyes after the evening of headlight
      glare.
    - choice:
        - I quietly cursed the light, wishing for the dark.
        - effect: Dark += 1
    - choice:
        - I quietly gave thanks for the light.
        - effect: Light += 1
  - I found my box, lucky 1313. <>
  - {Dark > 0} What a lovely number.
  - {Light > 0} What a joke. The number mocked me.
